In this problem, your task is to calculate SUM(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.
 
Input
The input will consist of a series of integers n, one integer per line.
 
Output
For each case, output SUM(n) in one line, followed by a blank line. You may assume the result will be in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
 
Sample Input

code:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int i, n, sum;
  while(scanf("%d",&n) != EOF)
  {
    sum = 0;
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      sum += i;
    printf("%d\n\n",sum);
  }
  return 0;
}
